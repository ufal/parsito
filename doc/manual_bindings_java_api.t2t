Java Parsito Bindings
========================

Parsito library bindings is available in the ``cz.cuni.mff.ufal.parsito``
package.

The bindings is a straightforward conversion of the ``C++`` bindings API.
Vectors do not have native Java interface, see
``cz.cuni.mff.ufal.parsito.Children`` class for reference. Also, class members
are accessible and modifiable using using ``getField`` and ``setField``
wrappers.

The bindings require native C++ library ``libparsito_java`` (called
``parsito_java`` on Windows). If the library is found in the current
directory, it is used, otherwise standard library search process is used.
The path to the C++ library can also be specified using static
``parsito_java.setLibraryPath(String path)`` call (before the first call
inside the C++ library, of course).
